A place for me to keep my progress and save my work for FreeCodeCamp projects and certifications, so that I can look back on what I have done and submit my work for grading. 

I plan to complete:

 - [ ] Relational Databases
 - [ ] Data Analysis with Python
 - [ ] Responsive Web Design
 - [ ] Backend Development and APIs
 - [ ] Information Security

Other Projects I had in mind:

 - [ ] assorted practice projects to learn data structures and algorithms and other concepts using C and Python
 - [ ] some practice web apps, maybe design a handful of web pages
 - [ ] learn about internet protocols such as TCP, HTTP, TLS and other networking concepts
 - [ ] learn about APIs and how to make one
